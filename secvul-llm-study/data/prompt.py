Here are some heuristics that might be helpful:
- A flow is tainted if at least one branch in the flow is tainted
- A flow is not tainted by dead branches (i.e., branches that will never be taken)
- Manipulations to tainted data structures may remove the taint (for example, removal of tainted elements in a data structure)

Code snippet:
int main(int argc, char **argv){{
    int nresp = packet_get_int();
    if (nresp > 0) {{
        response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
    for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++)
        response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
    }}
    return response[0];
}}

explanation: nresp is an integer. If nresp is a very large value, nresp*sizeof(char*) results in an overflow (because it will wrap around and result in the value 0).
Therefore, xmalloc() receives and allocates a 0-byte buffer. The following loop causes a heap buffer overflow as we write to a non-allocated memory location, which may, in turn, be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
response: vulnerability: YES | vulnerability type: CWE-190  | vulnerability name: Integer Overflow

Code snippet:
void setl(char* buffer, int size) {{
    if (size >= 0 && size < 10) {{
        buffer[size] = '\0';
    }}
}}

int main() {{
    char* buffer = new char[10];
    setl(buffer, 15);
    delete[] buffer;
    return 0;
}}

explanation: buffer is a character array of size 10. The setl function takes a pointer to the array buffer and size=15 as parameters. The setl method checks whether the size is less than 10 and if yes, limits buffer to that size.
This size check in setl prevents the snippet from being prone to an Out of Bounds Write since size=15 > size of buffer.
